# Java-21-CRUD-rest-API
# Important
This project is intended for educational purposes only and is not for commercial use.
Since the code has been modified there is no guarantee that it will compile, again, this is for educational purposes only

# Let’s clear some things out before we jump into conclusions,

1. this code was never used in production

2. this code does not exposes company secrets, all variable and API names are fictional, and do not exist in the real company,

3.the name records does not mean I was stealing company records, this was a naming convention that states that I was writing records/data to a data base and that’s it, nothing more

4 all data and databases related to this personal project has been deleted, and the server has been disposed as company policy states, HDDs and documents have been safely disposed on their proper bins, even if there is a host name variable, I didn’t use real hosts names, only made up names

# what was the goal of this project?

While working at this company I noticed that some old technologies are still used, now don’t get the wrong idea, I understand when places have very robust tools and they work, if it works, do not touch it, and I agree, only if it improves the workflow, then we can decide to use more modern technologies, the main goal of this project was to experiment with springboot and Java 21 using maven, since I also noticed a common issue and sometimes jokes online about how developers are still working with Java 8, or 10, I wanted to see how difficult was to write rest APIs using Java 21, even tho I had no Idea what rest API’s were at the time I worked on this project, but, I’m very familiar with MySQL, and it has been my preferred database of choice. So long story short, this code demonstrates a simple CRUD that connects to MySQL, last but not least, I used netbeans for this project so I know I could get more fancy tools like intelliJ, I made sure to only use public available tools, since I was not a developer at this company, and at the same time, I wanted to challenge myself by doing things manually, so I suffered a lot on this project, but it paid off, it made me a better coder, and it also made me understand more about the back end workflow of a web developer.
